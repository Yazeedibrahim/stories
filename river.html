    <h1>The River</h1>
    <center><img src="/home/yazeed/Desktop/Projects/websites/Story bookstore.com/river.jpeg" alt=""></center>
     <br>
     <p><b>I</b>n a small village along the edge of the mighty Zambezi River, there lived a young boy named Temba. The river was more than just water flowing from the mountains; it was the lifeblood of the land, shaping the people and the animals who called the riverbank home. <br><br>

        Temba’s village had always relied on the river for everything: drinking water, fish, and fertile soil for farming. The elders spoke of how the river had been kind to their ancestors, giving them what they needed to survive and thrive. But the river was also wild and unpredictable. <br><br> During the rainy season, it could rise up and flood the land, leaving behind destruction and loss.
        
        One day, as the sky darkened with the coming of a storm, Temba wandered to the riverbank. The Zambezi, known for its power, was swelling, its waters rushing faster and louder. Temba felt both awe and fear. He sat by the water, watching as the river churned with a ferocity he had never seen before.
        
        As he sat there, an old fisherman, Mzee Kwame, approached him. <br><br> 
        <img src="/home/yazeed/Desktop/Projects/websites/Story bookstore.com/boy.jpeg" alt="" style="float: right;">
        Mzee Kwame had lived by the river his entire life and had seen it in every mood imaginable. “The river is angry today,” he said softly, his eyes scanning the waters. “But do not fear, young one. The river does not give, without taking. And it does not take, without giving back.”
        
        Temba turned to the old man, confused. “What do you mean?”
        
        Mzee Kwame smiled, sitting beside him. <br> “The river takes life, but it also gives life. It carries fish to our nets, it brings water to our crops. <br>
        It can be dangerous, yes, but it is never without purpose. It teaches us patience and respect. We must always listen to it, for it knows the way.”
        
        As the storm passed, the river calmed, but Temba understood now. The river, like life itself, had its moments of fury and peace, and to truly live alongside it, one had to be aware of both. <br><br> The river would always give and take, and Temba would learn to walk with it in harmony.
        
        From that day on, Temba never saw the Zambezi River as something to fear. Instead, he saw it as a wise old friend—sometimes wild and unpredictable, but always teaching, always flowing forward.</p>
