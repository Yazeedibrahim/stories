    <h1>The stubborn goat</h1>
    <center><img src="/home/yazeed/Desktop/Projects/websites/Story bookstore.com/goat.jpeg" alt=""></center>
     <br>
     <p><b>O</b>nce upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a stubborn goat named Clove. Clove was not like other goats; while they eagerly followed their owners and nibbled on whatever was available, Clove had a mind of her. <br>

        Each morning, as the sun rose, Clove’s owner, Old Man Harvey, would open the gate to the meadow, where his herd would graze peacefully. But Clove? She refused to leave the barn. “Come on, Clove!” Harvey would call, holding a bundle of fresh hay. “The meadow is waiting.” <br><br>
        
        But Clove would just stand there, her head high, looking at him as if to say, *Not today, Harvey. I’m not in the mood. <br><br>
        
        One morning, Harvey decided to be clever. <br><br>
        <center><img src="/home/yazeed/Desktop/Projects/websites/Story bookstore.com/goat2.png" alt=""></center>
        He brought Clove’s favorite treat—a ripe apple—and held it out, waiting for her to Clove’s eyes flickered to the apple, then back to Harvey. She took a slow step forward, but then froze, snorting in defiance.
        
        “Ah, so it’s the apple you want, huh?” Harvey chuckled to He placed the apple in the meadow, just out of reach, and sat down, crossing his ar <br><br>ms. “If you want it, Clove, you’ll have to follow me.”
        
        Clove stared at the apple, then at the open meadow, and then, with a huff, trotted forward, determined not to let Harvey outsmart her. She wasn’t going to be tricked. But as she reached the meadow’s edge, something magical happened. The soft green grass tickled her hooves, the flowers swayed in the breeze, and the scent of fresh air filled her nostrils. She stopped.
        
        *Maybe* the meadow wasn’t so bad after all. Clove turned her head toward Harvey and gave him a small, reluctant nod. <br><br>
        
        “See?” Harvey grinned, “I knew you’d come around.” <br><br>
        
        And from that day on, Clove still remained a little stubborn, but she found joy in the meadow. She still didn’t like to be told what to do, but sometimes, just sometimes, even a stubborn goat could enjoy a bit of freedom—on her own terms.</p>
